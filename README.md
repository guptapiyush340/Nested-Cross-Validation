Comparison among models can be tricky and tedious task due to multiple hyper parameter settings and random split of data. Nested cross validation resolves the issue by selecting best performing algorithm overall. Implemented Nested cross validation to compare for 5 models i.e. Decision Tree, KNN, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine with rbf kernel.
